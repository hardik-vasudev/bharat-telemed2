## üîç Medicine Coding System

### How It Works
Every medicine has a unique **2-letter code** for quick identification:

| Medicine Code | Medicine Name | Generic Name | Strength |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **AC** | Paracetamol | Acetaminophen | 500mg |
| **IB** | Ibuprofen | Ibuprofen | 400mg |
| **AS** | Aspirin | Acetylsalicylic Acid | 325mg |
| **DC** | Diclofenac | Diclofenac Sodium | 50mg |
| **AX** | Amoxicillin | Amoxicillin | 500mg |
| **AZ** | Azithromycin | Azithromycin | 250mg |
| **CT** | Cetirizine | Cetirizine | 10mg |
| **OM** | Omeprazole | Omeprazole | 20mg |
| **VD** | Vitamin D3 | Cholecalciferol | 60000IU |

### Prescription Code Format
**Format:** `{MEDICINE_CODE}-{DOSAGE_NUMBER}-{DURATION_DAYS}`

**Examples:**
- `AC-2-7` = Paracetamol, 2 tablets, for 7 days
- `IB-1-5` = Ibuprofen, 1 tablet, for 5 days
- `AZ-1-3` = Azithromycin, 1 tablet, for 3 days
